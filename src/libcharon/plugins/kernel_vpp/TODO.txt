TODO:
  1) match tunnel based on destination SPI & destination IP address
  2) make decision based on test if IN SA src/dst and OUT SA src/dst are the same
      if true then do not store host_t *src, *dst (we just wait for next OUT call)
      !inbound
  4) get interface name of the new created IPSEC tunnel interface
      do we really need ipsec tunnel interface index ?
  5) test if we can use unnumbered ipsec tunnel interface (the same as our source interface
      address)
    *) if yes then we need to get interface index of this physical interface so we can
        set up unnumbered on our ipsec tunnel interace pointing to this one
      ?? hmm

  6) match inbound traffic based on inbound SPI & inbound IP
  7) set our local interface to promiscous enable (is this really required ?)
      - needs testing
